plugin component dlls
	last.fm now playing
	more control of activity hilighting (hilight on topic changes)
	ignores (for ignoring joins/quits/parts, maybe regular messages)
display help -- should show all commands at least
if FirstChannel is closed, direct privmsgs to a new channel window -- fixed?
page up, page down while input box is focused should scroll chat up/down
